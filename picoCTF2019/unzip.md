# Unzip

Can you unzip this [file](./assets/unzip/unzip.zip) and get the flag?

## Procedure
For unziping a .zip extension, we just have to type in our shell: `unzip unzip.zip` and we'll get a `flag.png` file that has `unz1pp1ng_1s_3a5y` in handwritting. Then we just have to adapt it to the flag format.

## Flag

`picoCTF{unz1pp1ng_1s_3a5y}`
